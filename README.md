    Text Classification
This project aims to classify book genres by analyzing book summaries. The workflow includes several key steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Data wrangling to clean and prepare the dataset.
Exploratory data analysis to gain insights from the data.
Feature Selection:

Identify and select relevant features for classification.
Algorithm Selection:

Evaluate and choose the best algorithms for text classification.
Objective
The primary goal is to accurately classify book genres based on their summaries. By leveraging various preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to achieve optimal classification performance.

Dataset
The dataset consists of book summaries along with their respective genres. It will be preprocessed to ensure data quality and relevance for training the classification models.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.
Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of genres, word frequencies, etc.
Feature Engineering:

Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as word frequencies, n-grams, etc.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Training various classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the selected models to improve performance.
Model Selection:

Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and cross-validation results.
Conclusion
The project concludes with the identification of the most effective approach for classifying book genres based on their summaries. Recommendations for further improvements or alternative methodologies may also be provided based on the findings.
